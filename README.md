simplifydigital test
In order to test your software development skills we would like you to complete a short technical exercise in your own time.  It should be possible to complete within an evening.  The aim is to create a small application allowing a user to store their energy bills, based on four user stories similar to ones you’d encounter working at Simplify Digital.  The user stories are of varying levels of difficulty, and will require you to make some assumptions and design decisions as you would in your day-to-day work.


Please send your completed application as a .zip or .rar file to ajeraj@simplifydigital.co.uk


We strongly recommend you complete the task in a language appropriate to the position you are applying for:
•	Back-end web developers should complete the task in C#.  (It’s your choice whether to create a console, WinForms, WPF, or ASP.net MVC application)
•	Front-end web developers should complete the task in HTML5 and Javascript.  You may use additional libraries such as jQuery and Knockout.
•	Android developers should complete the task as an Android app.  Please supply both .apk and source code.
•	iOS developers should complete the task as an iOS app.


Your application must satisfy the following four user stories.  Read all of them before starting work in order to help you choose the correct architecture and data structures for the exercise.


Although it is up to you how you implement the solution, we recommend your solution has the following features, if you are able to program them:


•	Some form of persistent storage between sessions.
•	An easy to understand user interface.




User Story 1
As a user of the energy bill calculator, I would like to be able to enter my name into the system, and also enter my suppliers for gas, electricity and water.
User Story 2
As a user of the energy bill calculator, I would like to be able to enter the following information for each of my bills:
•	Type (gas, electricity or water)
•	Date of bill
•	Amount (in £)
The application must allow me to store multiple bills.
User Story 3
As a user of the energy bill calculator, I would like to be able to search for all the bills I have paid within a given date range.  When searching, the application must display the following input fields:
•	Start date
•	End date
The application must display all of the bills within this range when I perform the search.
User Story 4
As a user of the energy bill calculator, I would like to see some statistics for my energy usage.  The application must display the following statistics on its main screen, for each service:
•	Average amount paid per bill
•	Total cost of all bills
•	Average cost per day (using the date of the first bill and today’s date as start and end dates, respectively.)
The application should also display these statistics when performing a search.  In this case, the average cost per day should be calculated using the start and end dates of the search.
